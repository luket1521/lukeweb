      <br>
      AUSTIN, TX
      <br><br>
      I am a student at Lake Travis High School and am currently
      enrolled in multiple honors and advanced placement classes.
      In my high school career i have been AB honor roll with a 97
      weighted average. For all of high school, I have been in the
      marching band and in the symphonic division of concert band.
      I joined jazz band Junior year and plan to do it senior year.
      I am also on the robotics competition team (on which
      we have won competitions and competed in regional and state
      competitions), and I am taking classes from UT Austin and
      austin community college. I plan to major in mechanical
      engineering or computer science. I am looking forward to
      going to college soon in the state of texas eventually
      pursuing a masters degree.
